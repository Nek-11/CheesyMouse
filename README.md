# 🧀 CheesyMouse - Wine Cellar Adventure

Navigate a brave mouse through a treacherous wine cellar, collecting cheese while avoiding deadly wine bottle shelves.

This is a fun little project where I tested something I've never done before (game design) by vibe-coding it with Cursor. Just wanted to see what would happen if I tried to build a simple "Flappy Bird clone" from scratch.
